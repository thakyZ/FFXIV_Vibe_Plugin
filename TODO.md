# TODO & IDEAS

## Scheduled
- Custom patterns
- Feature to export trigger (without TriggerDevice)
- Use values from damage/heal amount as intensity
- Add sort ID for triggers
- Move loss of HP/Power into triggers


## Ideas
- Make start/stop after part of the motor <=== custom pattern would solve this ?
